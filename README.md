# Learning jQuery

Welcome to the learning journey of jQuery! This README will guide you through the basics of jQuery and provide resources to help you get started.

## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

## Getting Started

To start learning jQuery, you'll first need to include jQuery in your HTML file. You can do this by either downloading jQuery and hosting it on your server, or by using a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Here's how you can include jQuery using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of jQuery revolves around the use of the dollar sign (`$`) function to select elements and perform actions on them. Here's a simple example that changes the text of an element with the ID `myElement`:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("#myElement").text("Hello, jQuery!");
});
```
